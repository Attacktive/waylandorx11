# Am I using Wayland or X11?

## Intro: The use case

Fedora 36 was launched on may 2022. It included full Wayland support. But some
meeting applications (Zoom, Google Meet...) do not fully support Wayland. In
those applications, the camera works, but screen sharing doesn't. So I need to
switch my desktop between X11 and Wayland, and I wanted a quick and visual way
to see if my desktop is currently using X11 or Wayland. So, I made this
extension.
